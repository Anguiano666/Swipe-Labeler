# Swipe-Labeler Tool

This graphical user interface tool allows for rapid labeling of image data. Images from your unlabeled images directory will be presented one at a time in a graphical user interface. For each image, the user can choose to either “Accept” or “Reject” the image for the classification in question. For example, if you’re looking to label images as either containing or not containing a cat, the user would choose “Accept” for any cat image presented and “Reject” for any image presented that doesn’t contain a cat. The application then moves the newly labeled image file from your unlabeled images directory to your chosen positive or negative directory, depending on the user’s label choice. The user has three methods to classify each presented image.  The user may: click on the “Accept” or “Reject” buttons, swipe the image to the right for “Accept” or to the left for “Reject”, or use the keyboard right arrow key for “Accept” and the keyboard left arrow key for “Reject”.
